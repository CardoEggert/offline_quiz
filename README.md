# offline_quiz 

## Notes

This is a quiz that can be ran locally. This was mostly for me to practise AngularJS framework and to try out Test-Driven-Development using Spring Boot. I learned a lot about AngularJS and TDD, even though they both need a bit more practising.

## Capabilities

This quiz allows questions with a picture. The quiz is in estonian and the questions are chosen randomly (if there is any questions). 
<br>
There can be multiple right answers or only one right answer ( there must be a right answer ).

After finishing the test, there is a chance to overview what went wrong and what right.
